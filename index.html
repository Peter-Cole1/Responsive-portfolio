                    <p>Welcome to my portfolio page. I'm the kind of person that gets lost in whatever is the focus of my attention. I love trying to get complex concepts to play out in a way similar to how I see it it my head. That could apply to trying to make a certain passage in a song that I've written flow, while syncopating multiple time signatures into a polyrhythmic groove (I realize that sounded like nonsense to a lot of people, sorry). It could also apply to custom software I use to animate my phone homescreen, using conditional animations and the like. I just like creating cool things, and appreciate when people can get something out of something I've created. Naturally, this applies with coding as well, and I'm excited to see this portfolio grow with projects that I find interesting.</p>
